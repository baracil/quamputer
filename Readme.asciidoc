= Quamputer : Yet Another Quantum Computer Simulator
:author: Bastien Aracil

WARNING: Work in Progress


== Code Sample

```rust
use quamputer::computer::QuantumComputer;
use quamputer::gate::Gate::{Hadamard, Not};
use quamputer::gate::cnot;


fn main() {
    let computer = QuantumComputer::new(2);
    let mut circuit = computer.new_circuit();

    circuit.push(Hadamard(0))
        .push(Not(1).with_one_control(0));
        // there are shortcut for Cnot and Toffoli like cnot(0,1);

    let executable = computer.compile(&circuit);

    let initial_state = computer.zero_state();

    let result = executable.execute(&initial_state);


    println!("input  : {:?}", initial_state);
    println!("result : {:?}", result);
}
```

This will print:
```
input  : State 2 qbits :  (1.000000,0.000000)x|00> (0.000000,0.000000)x|01> (0.000000,0.000000)x|10> (0.000000,0.000000)x|11>
result : State 2 qbits :  (0.707107,0.000000)x|00> (0.000000,0.000000)x|01> (0.000000,0.000000)x|10> (0.707107,0.000000)x|11>

```
